## If you found bug

... then you can choose one of three paths:  
  **1.** Ignore it. Maybe, sometime, someone find it too and tell me about it.  
  **2.** Create [bug report](https://github.com/nilproject/NiL.JS/issues). It will take some time, but will reduce time to fix it.  
  **3.** Fork project and fix bug by yourself, then create pull request.  

I hope that you will not choose the first path.
